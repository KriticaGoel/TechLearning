Design a class diagram for an elevator system in a multi-story building, addressing the core functionalities and interactions among different components of the system.

Requirements:

Multiple Elevators Support: The system should support multiple elevators.
Floor Navigation: Ability to move to different floors and maintain the current floor state.
Request Handling: Process external requests (floor button presses) and internal requests (buttons inside the elevator).
Direction and Status Indicators: Display current direction (up or down) and status (moving, idle, maintenance).
Queue Management: Manage a queue of floor requests and optimize the order of execution.
Overload Protection: Prevent operation if the elevator is overloaded.
Emergency Handling: Implement emergency features like alarm buttons and emergency stop functionality.
Scheduled Maintenance Mode: Enable/disable elevators for scheduled maintenance.
Energy Efficiency Mode: Optimize the operation for energy efficiency during low usage periods.
User Interface: Provide a user interface inside the elevator for floor selection and information display.
