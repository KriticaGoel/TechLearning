Step 0: Understand the problem by sharing your understanding 
        and clarify the question if any

Step 1: Requirements—Take 2-3 min and thing about the requirement then ask clarification question in one go
1. Size of board is n*n 
2. No. of player: n-1
3. Each player can have their own symbol. Two players can't have the same symbol.
4. Can we have bots? only one is allowed
5. Bot will have a difficulty level—Easy, Medium, Hard
6. Who will make the first move? Random
7. Players can't leave in between
8. How is the winner decided? row, col, diag, corners
9. Flexibility: we need to choose which rule to apply which not
10. Game can end in draw
11. Undo feature : global layer undo
12. Replay
13. Database
14. leaderboard
15. timer
16. tournament
17. Autoplay
18. pause/resume
19. exit
20. 

Step 3: Class diagram

1. Identify the noun or,
2. Visualization of a system from outside to inside and after check whether all requirements is covered or not
3. Identify entities and design pattern 
Going outside to inside
Question 1: What should be the most important class in game TicTacToe
Answer1: Game

Step 4: Data model

Step 5: Create all models and enum
* Game
  * GameStatus enum
* Board
* Players
  * PlayerType enum
  * HumanPlayer
  * BotPlayer
    * BotDifficultyLevel enum
* Move
* Cell
  * CellStatus enum
* Symbol


Step 6: Create controller class
        GameController - startGame(),
                         getGameState(),
                         display(),
                         makeMove(),
                         undo(),
                         getWinner()
Step 7: Create client class
        
        Game start
        
                 board size

                 PlayerList

                 WinningStrategy
        
        Display the board
        
        Ask current player to make a move
        
        After making move if state changes
        
            Check winner or draw
        
               if yes game over
        
               else game continues


Step 8: Create all constructors

*   Game Constructor—size, players, winningStrategyList (Using builder design pattern)
*   Board Constructor—size
*   Cell Constructor - i,j
*   Player Constructor
*   Bot Constructor
*   Human Constructor 
*   Symbol Constructor
*   Move Constructor

Step 9: Bot Playing strategy

Step 10: Implement function Display Board

Step 11: Implement Winning Strategy

Step 12: Implement Make Move

* Controller called game makeMove method
* Game called Player makeMove method
* Human we need input in form of row and column
* Bot we need to return move based on BotDifficultyLevel
* Validate the move
* Update cell, board and move
* checkWinner and update game status

Step 13: Implement Undo

* last move identify
* Fetch last row column
* Update last cell status to empty and remove the symbol
* Go to previous move by updating turn
* Update the row count after undo in winner strategy
* Update Game State and winner
