### Streams

> A stream in Java is simply a wrapper around a data source, allowing us to perform bulk operations on the data
> conveniently.

The Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, is a powerful abstraction for processing sequences of
elements, such as collections or arrays, in a functional and declarative way.

Streams are designed to be used in a chain of operations, allowing you to create complex data processing pipelines.

### Advantages of Streams

The motivation for introducing streams in Java was to provide a more concise, readable, and expressive way to process
sequences of data elements, such as collections or arrays.

**Readability and Expressiveness:** Streams provide focus on opertions that developer wants to perform on the data
rather
then the mechanics of how to perform them.
Traditional loops often involve low-level details like index manipulation and
explicit iteration, which can make the code harder to read and understand.

**Code Reduction:** Streams allow you to perform complex operations on data elements in a more concise and compact
manner compared to traditional loops. This leads to fewer lines of code and improved code maintainability.

**Parallelism:** Streams can be easily converted to parallel streams, allowing you to take advantage of multi-core
processors and perform operations concurrently. This can lead to improved performance for certain types of data
processing tasks.

**Separation of Concerns:** With traditional loops, you often mix the concerns of iterating over elements, filtering,
mapping, and aggregation within a single loop. Streams encourage a separation of concerns by providing distinct
operations that can be chained together in a more modular way.

**Lazy Evaluation:** Streams introduce lazy evaluation, which means that operations are only performed when the results
are actually needed. This can lead to improved performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

**Functional Programming:** Streams embrace functional programming concepts by providing
operations that transform data in a functional and immutable manner. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior
of your code and reduces the potential for side effects.

**Data Abstraction:** Streams abstract away the underlying data source, allowing you to work with different data
sources (collections, arrays, I/O channels) in a consistent way. This makes your code more flexible and reusable.

In summary, the motivation behind introducing streams in Java was to provide a modern, expressive, and functional
programming paradigm for processing data elements, enabling developers to write more readable, maintainable, and
efficient code. Streams simplify complex data manipulations, encourage separation of concerns, and support parallel
processing, contributing to improved code quality and developer productivity.

### 1. Creating Streams

**Example 1: Creating a Stream from a Collection**

```java
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango");
List<Integer> ls = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Creating a stream from a collection
Stream<String> fruitStream = fruits.stream();
```

**Example 2: Creating a Stream from an Array**

```java
String[] cities = {"New York", "London", "Tokyo", "Paris"};

// Creating a stream from an array
Stream<String> cityStream = Arrays.stream(cities);
```

**Example 3: Creating a Stream of Integers**

```java
IntStream intStream = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
// Creating a stream of integers
intStream.

forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

### 2. Intermediate Operations

Intermediate operations are operations that transform a stream into another stream. They are lazy, meaning they don't
execute until a terminal operation is invoked. There are two types of operations that you can perform on a stream:
Some examples of intermediate operations are filter(), map(), sorted(), distinct(), limit(), and skip().

Filtering and Mapping Example:

```java
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango");

// Filtering fruits starting with 'A' and converting to uppercase
List<String> result = fruits.stream()
        .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith("A"))
        .map(String::toUpperCase)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.

println(result); // Output: [APPLE]
```

**Filtering**
The filter() method is used to filter elements from a stream based on a predicate. It takes a predicate as an argument
and returns a stream that contains only those elements that match the predicate. For example, let's filter out the even
numbers from a stream of numbers:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Stream<Integer> evenNumbers = stream.filter(number -> number % 2 == 0);
```

Here, we have created a stream of numbers and filtered out the even numbers from the stream. The `filter()` method takes
a predicate as an argument. A predicate is a functional interface that takes an argument and returns a boolean result.
It is defined in the java.util.function package. It contains the test() method that takes an argument of type T and
returns a boolean result. For example, let's create a
predicate that checks if a number is even:

```java
Predicate<Integer> isEven = number -> number % 2 == 0;
```

Here, we have created a predicate called isEven that checks if a number is even. We can use this predicate to filter out
the even numbers from a stream of numbers as follows:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Stream<Integer> evenNumbers = stream.filter(isEven);
```

**Mapping**
The map() method is used to transform elements in a stream. It takes a function as an argument and returns a stream that
contains the results of applying the function to each element in the stream. For
example, let's convert a stream of numbers to a stream of their squares:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Stream<Integer> squares = stream.map(number -> number * number);
```

Here, we have created a stream of numbers and converted it to a stream of their squares. The map() method takes a
function as an argument. A function is a functional interface that takes an argument and returns a result. It is defined
in the java.util.function package. It contains the apply() method that takes an argument of type T and returns a result
of type R. For example, let's create a function that converts
a number to its square:

```java 
Function<Integer, Integer> square = number -> number * number;
```

Here, we have created a function called square that converts a number to its square. We can use this function to convert
a stream of numbers to a stream of their squares as follows:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Stream<Integer> squares = stream.map(square);
```

**Sorting**
The sorted() method is used to sort elements in a stream. It takes a comparator as an argument and returns a stream that
contains the elements sorted according to the comparator. For example, let's sort a stream of numbers in ascending
order:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(5, 3, 1, 4, 2);
Stream<Integer> sortedNumbers = stream.sorted();
```

Here, we have created a stream of numbers and sorted it in ascending order. The sorted() method takes a comparator as an
argument. A comparator is a functional interface that compares two objects of the same type. It is defined in the
`java.util.function package`. It contains the compare() method that takes two arguments of type T and returns an integer
result. For example, let's create a comparator that
compares two numbers:

```java
Comparator<Integer> comparator = (number1, number2) -> number1 - number2;
```

Here, we have created a comparator called comparator that compares two numbers. We can use this comparator to sort a
stream of numbers in ascending order as follows:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(5, 3, 1, 4, 2);
Stream<Integer> sortedNumbers = stream.sorted(comparator);
```

### 3. Terminal operations

Terminal operations trigger the processing of elements and produce a result or a side effect. They are the final step in
a stream pipeline. They are eager, which means that they are executed immediately. Some examples of terminal operations
are
forEach(), count(), collect(), reduce(), min(), max(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), and
noneMatch().

**Iterating**
The forEach() method is used to iterate over the elements in a stream. It takes a consumer as an argument and invokes
the consumer for each element in the stream. For example, let's iterate over a stream of numbers and print each number:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
stream.

forEach(number ->System.out.

println(number));
```

**Reducing**
The reduce() method is used to reduce the elements in a stream to a single value. It takes an identity value and a
binary operator as arguments and returns the result of applying the binary operator to the identity value and the
elements in the stream. For example, let's find the sum of all the numbers in a stream:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = stream.reduce(0, (number1, number2) -> number1 + number2);
```

Here, we have created a stream of numbers and found the sum of all the numbers in the stream. The reduce() method takes
an identity value and a binary operator as arguments. A binary operator is a functional interface that takes two
arguments of the same type and returns a result of the same type. It is defined in the java.util.function package. It
contains the apply() method that takes two arguments of type T and returns a result of type T. For example, let's create
a binary operator that adds two numbers:

```java
BinaryOperator<Integer> add = (number1, number2) -> number1 + number2;
```

Here, we have created a binary operator called add that adds two numbers. We can use this binary operator to find the
sum of all the numbers in a stream as follows:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = stream.reduce(0, add);
```

**Collecting**
The collect() method is used to collect the elements in a stream into a collection. It takes a collector as an argument
and returns the result of applying the collector to the elements in the stream. For example,let's collect the elements
in a stream into a list:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> numbers = stream.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

You can now use the toList() method on streams to collect the elements in a stream into a list.

```
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> numbers = stream.toList();
```

Similarly, you can use the toSet() method on streams to collect the elements in a stream into a set.

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Set<Integer> numbers = stream.toSet();
```

**Finding the first element**
The findFirst() method is used to find the first element in a stream. It returns an Optional that contains the first
element in the stream. For example, let's find the first even number in a stream of numbers:

```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Optional<Integer> firstEvenNumber = stream.filter(number -> number % 2 ==
        0).findFirst();
```

### More Examples

**Example1: Collecting into a List**

```java
public collectingList() {
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango");

// Collecting filtered fruits into a new list
List<String> result = fruits.stream()
        .filter(fruit -> fruit.length() > 5)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

    System.out.println(result); // Output: [Banana, Orange]
}
```

**Example2: Counting Elements**

```java 
public counting() {
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango");

// Counting the number of fruits
long count = fruits.stream()
        .filter(fruit -> fruit.length() > 5)
        .count();

    System.out.println("Number of fruits: " + count); // Output: Number of fruits: 2
}
```

**Example3: Joining Strings**

```java
public JoiningString() {
    List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Hello", " ", "Stream", " ", "API");

// Concatenating strings
    String result = words.stream().collect(Collectors.joining());
    System.out.println("Concatenated String: " + result);
}// Output: Concatenated String: Hello Stream API
```

### Multithreading using Java Streams

### Sequential Streams

By default, any stream operation in Java is processed sequentially, unless explicitly specified as parallel.

Sequential streams use a single thread to process the pipeline:

```java
public seqStream() {
List<Integer> listOfNumbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
    listOfNumbers.stream().forEach(number -> System.out.println(number + " " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
}
```

The output of this sequential stream is predictable. The list elements will always be printed in an ordered sequence:

```
1 main
2 main
3 main
4 main
```

### Parallel Streams

Stream API also simplifies multithreading by providing the `parallelStream()` method that runs operations over stream’s
elements in parallel mode. Any stream in Java can easily be transformed from sequential to parallel.

We can achieve this by adding the parallel method to a sequential stream or by creating a stream using the
parallelStream method of a collection:

The code below allows to run method doWork() in parallel for every element of the stream:

```java
list.parallelStream().

forEach(element ->

doWork(element));
```

For the above sequential example, the code will looks like this -

```java
List<Integer> listOfNumbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
listOfNumbers.

parallelStream().
forEach(number ->
        System.out.

println(number +" "+Thread.currentThread().

getName())
        );
```

Parallel streams enable us to execute code in parallel on separate cores. The final result is the combination of each
individual outcome.

However, the order of execution is out of our control. It may change every time we run the program:

```
4 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
2 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5
1 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7
3 main
```

Parallel streams do not always bring performance benefits. We considered the overhead of managing multiple threads,
memory locality, splitting the source and merging the results.

### Additional Topics

### Collect() Method

A stream represents a sequence of elements and supports different kinds of operations that lead to the desired result.
The source of a stream is usually a Collection or an Array, from which data is streamed from.

Streams differ from collections in several ways; most notably in that the streams are not a data structure that stores
elements. They're functional in nature, and it's worth noting that operations on a stream produce a result and typically
return another stream, but do not modify its source.

To "solidify" the changes, you **collect** the elements of a stream back into a Collection.

The `stream.collect()` method is used to perform a mutable reduction operation on the elements of a stream. It returns a
new mutable object containing the results of the reduction operation.

This method can be used to perform several different types of reduction operations, such as:

- Computing the sum of numeric values in a stream.
- Finding the minimum or maximum value in a stream.
- Constructing a new String by concatenating the contents of a stream.
- Collecting elements into a new List or Set.

```java
public class CollectExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        // Creating a List from an array of elements
        // using Arrays.asList() method
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(intArray);

        // Demo1: Collecting all elements of the list into a new 
        // list using collect() method 
        List<Integer> evenNumbersList = list.stream()
                .filter(i -> i % 2 == 0)
                .collect(toList());
        System.out.println(evenNumbersList);

        // Demo2: finding the sum of all the values 
        // in the stream
        Integer sum = list.stream()
                .collect(summingInt(i -> i));
        System.out.println(sum);

        // Demo3: finding the maximum of all the values 
        // in the stream
        Integer max = list.stream()
                .collect(maxBy(Integer::compare)).get();
        System.out.println(max);

        // Demo4: finding the minimum of all the values 
        // in the stream
        Integer min = list.stream()
                .collect(minBy(Integer::compare)).get();
        System.out.println(min);

        // Demo5: counting the values in the stream
        Long count = list.stream()
                .collect(counting());
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

In Demo1:  We use the stream() method to get a stream from the list. We filter the even elements and collect them into a
new list using the collect() method.

In Demo2: We use the collect() method summingInt(ToIntFunction) as an argument. The summingInt() method returns a
collector that sums the integer values extracted from the stream elements by applying an int producing mapping function
to each element.

In Demo 3: We use the collect() method with maxBy(Comparator) as an argument. The maxBy() accepts a Comparator and
returns a collector that extracts the maximum element from the stream according to the given Comparator.

Lets learn more about Collectors.

### Collectors Class

Collectors represent implementations of the Collector interface, which implements various useful reduction operations,
such as accumulating elements into collections, summarizing elements based on a specific parameter, etc.

Within the Collectors class itself, we find an abundance of unique methods that deliver on the different needs of a
user. One such group is made of summing methods - `summingInt()`, `summingDouble()` and `summingLong()`.

Let's start off with a basic example with a List of Integers:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Integer sum = numbers.stream().collect(Collectors.summingInt(Integer::intValue));
System.out.

println("Sum: "+sum);
```

We apply the .stream() method to create a stream of Integer instances, after which we use the previously discussed
`.collect()` method to collect the elements using `summingInt()`. The method itself, again, accepts the `ToIntFunction`,
which can be used to reduce instances to an integer that can be summed.

Since we're using Integers already, we can simply pass in a method reference denoting their `intValue`, as no further
reduction is needed.

More often than not - you'll be working with lists of custom objects and would like to sum some of their fields. For
instance, we can sum the quantities of each product in the productList, denoting the total inventory we have.

Let us try to understand one of these methods using a custom class example.

``` java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private Integer quantity;
    private Double price;
    private Long productNumber;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
    ...
}
...
List<Product> products = Arrays.asList(
        new Product("Milk", 37, 3.60, 12345600L),
        new Product("Carton of Eggs", 50, 1.20, 12378300L),
        new Product("Olive oil", 28, 37.0, 13412300L),
        new Product("Peanut butter", 33, 4.19, 15121200L),
        new Product("Bag of rice", 26, 1.70, 21401265L)
);

```

In such a case, the we can use a method reference, such as `Product::getQuantity` as our `ToIntFunction`, to reduce the
objects into a single integer each, and then sum these integers:

```java
Integer sumOfQuantities = products.stream().collect(Collectors.summingInt(Product::getQuantity));
System.out.

println("Total number of products: "+sumOfQuantities);
```

This results in:

```
Total number of products: 174
```

You can also very easily implement your own collector and use it instead of the predefined ones, though - you can get
pretty far with the built-in collectors, as they cover the vast majority of cases in which you might want to use them.

The following are examples of using the predefined collectors to perform common mutable reduction tasks:

```java

// Accumulate names into a List
List<String> list = people.stream().map(Person::getName).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Accumulate names into a TreeSet
Set<String> set = people.stream().map(Person::getName).collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));

// Convert elements to strings and concatenate them, separated by commas
String joined = things.stream()
        .map(Object::toString)
        .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));

// Compute sum of salaries of employee
int total = employees.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary)));

// Group employees by department
Map<Department, List<Employee>> byDept
        = employees.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment));

// Compute sum of salaries by department
Map<Department, Integer> totalByDept
        = employees.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary)));

// Partition students into passing and failing
Map<Boolean, List<Student>> passingFailing =
        students.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.getGrade() >= PASS_THRESHOLD));

```
