### Agenda



### Builder Design pattern
> This design pattern is useful when you need to construct a complex object step by step. 
> It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, 
> allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Problem**: Complex construction logic, Immutable Objects, Different Representations, Avoid Telescoping Constructor Problem, Code Clarity and Maintainability

**Solution**: A builder design pattern 
allows incremental and controlled construction of objects, 
you can reuse the same building process to create different types of objects,
keeps the creation logic separate from the representation of the final object.

**Applications**:
1. UI Builders: Building graphical user interfaces with complex layouts and styles.
2. Report Generators: Creating reports in different formats like PDF, Word, or HTML.
3. Vehicle Assembly: Constructing vehicles with customizable options (e.g., engine type, color, interiors).
4. Meal Builders: Designing combo meals in a restaurant ordering system.

### Factory Design pattern

Based on something we need object
like based on a device, we need an object
based on strategy, we need an object (if a Strategy Design pattern is there)
