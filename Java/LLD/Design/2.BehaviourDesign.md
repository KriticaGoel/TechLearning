### Memento Pattern 
 > This design pattern helps in storing the 
 snapshots of its state after any change, 
 enabling the user to revert to previous states.
 > It is used in Undo and Redo
 
**Problem:** How to provide undo/redo functionality or state restoration without exposing the objects internal state and breaking encapsulation.

**Solution:** The memento pattern captures the internal state of an object in a memento, allowing objects to restore the state later on without revealing internal details.

#### Memento pattern Structure

Components:
1. Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. Memento: Captures and stores the internal state of the originator.
3. Caretaker: Manages and stores the mementos, without modifying them.
