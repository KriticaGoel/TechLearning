* What is version Control system?

Allow us to maintain the code version.

There are teo type of Version control system:
1. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

In this system, there is a single central repository where all the code is stored. Developers check out code from this central repository, make changes, and then check the code back in. 

*Pros* - Simple to understand and use, especially for small teams. It provides a single source of truth for the codebase, making it easier to manage and track changes.

*Con* - Single point of failure, if the server goes down, no one can commit code. 

*Examples* - SVN, CVS, Perforce. `

2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) - 

In this system, each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. Developers can work independently and commit changes to their local repository. They can then push their changes to a shared remote repository when they are ready. 

*Pros* - No single point of failure, developers can work offline and commit code locally. 

*Cons* - More complex to understand and use, especially for beginners. It can lead to more complex merge conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same codebase.

*Examples* - Git, Mercurial, Bazaar


Git - DVCS
Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket - all are web-based platforms for hosting and managing Git repositories
