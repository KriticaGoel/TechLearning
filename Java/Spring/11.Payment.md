Implement payment service

Integrate Stripe


Payment Controller  ---> Payment Service 

(since we have many payment service and we don't want to change the existing classes while integrating new payment provider thats why we will create payment service as a interface and add as many payment provider as neeeded)



1. Create PaymentController
   1.1. generatePaymentLink:
            Input :  oder id
            Output : payment link
            Process: Call OrderService to get order details then call Payment Service
2. Create a Payment Service interface 
        method: generatePaymentLink
3.  Create classes RazonPaymentService, StripePaymentService, PhonepayPaymentService implements PaymentService
4.  StripePaymentProvider is a primary
5. Create account in stripe and save secret key
6. use doc to implement https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/api?lang=java#create-link
7. https://docs.stripe.com/api/products
8. save secret key in environment variable -> debugConfiguration -> environment
9. $10.00 = 1000L
10. last two places are for  
11. search test cards for stripes for India
12. https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/
13. Create a webhook in order service (use localtunnel to host temporary) to update the sttaus of payment.
14. Call the above webhook from Payment gateway.



Design pattern used:
1. Adaptor Pattern
2. Builder Pattern - payment providers
